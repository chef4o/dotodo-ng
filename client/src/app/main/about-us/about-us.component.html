        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I am really passionate about technology and programming, a journey that led me to create this task management
            website.
            Inspired by my learning at SoftUni, this platform is designed to help people manage their time more
            effectively.
            It's an evolving space, constantly improving to meet user needs. My goal is to offer a practical and
            straightforward
            tool for everyone who seeks better organization in their daily routine. This website reflects my
            dedication
            to making
            time management easier and more accessible for all.
